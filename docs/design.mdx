## Overall Design

**Disclaimer**: This is an open-source design we are sharing in the context of the pandemic. This is not an approved medical device and we do not advise any individual implementation. We are working with industrial partners to scale up this implementation - but sharing in open domain for other industry partners to engage as well. Please reach out to us and join the effort if you are interested in developing and validating the system for clinical evaluation.

Here we present a simple, rapidly manufacturable pulse-dose oxygen delivery system which conserves oxygen by delivering it on patient demand. A schematic of the device is shown in Figure 3. The device mainly consists of a flow-control valve and pressure sensor in line with the standard pressure/flow regulator on an oxygen cylinder. The pressure sensor detects the start of  patient inhalation and opens the valve to allow oxygen flow to the patient. Similarly the end of the inhalation cycle is detected and the flow of oxygen reduced or stopped. An alarm must be installed to indicate a missed signal, either due to device malfunction or improper cannula connection.

A key aspect of our work last year was development and manufacturing of indigineous valves for this purpose. With a shortage of supply chains - we built a new valve design in collaboration with Dan Harris lab (Brown) and Kai Kuck (U. Utah). We are now scaling production of these indiginous pinch-shoe valves since they alleviate many issues with lack of medical grade valve availability or use of grease and other volatiles used in traditional valves. Most importantly, we tested these valves for millions of cycles to characterize wear and tear.
