# Need & Concept

## Rationale & Need

The Indian subcontinent and parts of Southeast Asia are currently facing a devastating second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Oxygen shortage is an urgent issue in many major cities and towns where infections have spiked. There is currently an urgent need for solutions to help conserve the already limited oxygen supply. This becomes even more important since, due to lack of hospital beds, a lot of care needs to be administered in a home or field hospital setting. Despite a capacity to produce at least 7,100 tonnes of oxygen every day, India is struggling to provide it where it is needed the most due to a supply chain and distribution issue.[^ghoshal] In many settings oxygen cylinders are the main mode of oxygen delivery.

**A device which conserves oxygen will extend the life of cylinders and will help in this climate of extreme shortages.** In addition to minimizing the oxygen consumption, oxygen conservation devices have made it possible for oxygen cylinders to be easily portable by decreasing its size by 4-5 times.[^tiep]

## Concept

In oxygen therapy, when a patient exhales out, the oxygen still leaks away - thus wasting up to approximately <sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> or more of oxygen in the tank as inhalation only amounts to approximately <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> of the respiration cycle. If a sensor can sense inhalation-exhalation cycles, and oxygen flow can be stopped or diverted to a buffer storage during exhalation, then we could save this oxygen and thus increase the life of an oxygen tank by almost three times (and hence tripling the supply).

**Fig. 2**: Pulsed oxygen flow allows the use of a considerably smaller average supplemental nasal oxygen flow rate to achieve the same end-tidal oxygen concentration. E.g., in data from 30 volunteers, to achieve an end-tidal (exhaled) oxygen concentration of 44%, continuous flow (CFO) needed 6 L/min, while pulsed flow (PFO) only needed about 2 L/min. The oxygen savings are disproportionately larger as the oxygen needs increase.[^burk]

Oxygen conservation devices already exist and can allow significant savings of oxygen[^mccoy]<sup>,</sup>[^burk]<sup>,</sup>[^fuhrman] - but their cost is in the $200 range, and they are not widely available.

**The goal of the proposed device is to implement a simple yet safe version of a pulse-dose system that can be rapidly manufactured and deployed in the context of the current situation in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia.** Our goal is to work with industrial partners to bring this device to the market with quality and scale. The device is envisioned to be used in settings where patients with mild conditions are being treated; it is not intended for severe COVID-19 patients.

## Requirements

The main requirements of the pulse-dose oxygen conservation device are as follows:

- The device should deliver oxygen to the patient during the inspiratory phase while conserving oxygen during the expiratory phase.
- The device should deliver oxygen during the first part of the inspiratory phase after commencement of inhalation, to ensure most of the oxygen delivered is "useful oxygen" that reaches the alveoli.
- The device should robustly detect inhalation by setting a suitable pressure trigger point
- The device should trigger robustly under different different user conditions, including movement and sleep.
- The pneumatic system should have a fail-open design which provides continuous oxygen flow to minimize the impact of any device failures on patient safety. In a fail-open state, the flow rate should be controlled at the flow regulator attached to the oxygen cylinder.

Additional requirements for usability are as follows:

- Robustness:
  - The device should be water resistant/splash-proof.
  - The device should remain functional after being dropped.
- Versatility:
  - The device should be portable.
  - It should be possible to power the device from a variety of power sources.
- The device should be tamper-proof.
- Requirement for COVID-19 patients: the device should have an alarm for high respiratory rate.
