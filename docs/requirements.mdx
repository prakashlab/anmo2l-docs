# Requirements

India is currently facing a devastating second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Oxygen shortage is an urgent issue in many major cities and towns where infections have spiked. There is currently an urgent need for solutions to help conserve the already limited oxygen supply. This becomes even more important since, due to lack of hospital beds, a lot of care needs to be administered in a home setting. Despite a capacity to produce at least 7,100 tonnes of oxygen every day, the country is struggling to provide it where it is needed the most due to a supply chain and distribution issue.[^ghoshal] In such settings oxygen cylinders are the main mode of oxygen delivery.

**A device that conserves oxygen will extend the life of cylinders and will help in this climate of extreme shortages.** In addition to minimizing the oxygen consumption,oxygen conservation devices have made it possible for oxygen cylinders to be easily portable by decreasing its size by 4-5 times.[^tiep]

In oxygen therapy, when a patient exhales out, the oxygen still leaks away - thus wasting up to ~2/3rd or more of oxygen in the tank as inhalation only amounts to ~1/3rd of the respiration cycle. If a sensor can sense inhale-exhale cycles and oxygen flow can be stopped or diverted to a buffer storage during exhalation; we could save this oxygen increasing the life of an oxygen tank by almost three times (and hence tripling the supply).

**Fig. 2**: Pulsed oxygen flow allows the use of a considerably smaller average supplemental nasal oxygen flow rate to achieve the same end-tidal oxygen concentration. E.g., in data from 30 volunteers, to achieve an end-tidal (exhaled) oxygen concentration of 44%, continuous flow (CFO) needed 6 L/min, while pulsed flow (PFO) only needed about 2 L/min. The oxygen savings are disproportionately larger as the oxygen needs increase.[^burk]

Oxygen conservation devices already exist and can allow significant savings of oxygen[^mccoy]<sup>,</sup>[^burk]<sup>,</sup>[^fuhrman] - but they cost $200 range and are not widely available. 

**The goal of the proposed device is to implement a simple yet safe version of a pulse-dose system that can be rapidly manufactured and deployed in the context of the current situation in India. Our goal is to work with industrial partners to bring this device to the market with quality and scale.** The envisioned device can also be delivered along with the new oxygen cylinders being manufactured.

The device is envisioned to be used in settings where patients with mild conditions are being treated; and not used for severe covid patients.
