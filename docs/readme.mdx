The surge of COVID-19 cases in India and around the world has resulted in an acute oxygen shortage. Oxygen therapy through nasal cannula with flow rates of 1 - 6 L/min is an effective treatment for many COVID-19 patients in non-critical conditions and can help prevent disease progression. The same treatment is also used in post-acute care recovering COVID-19 patients. Here we describe a simple, open source, and rapidly manufacturable oxygen conservation device for use with dual port nasal cannulas which can extend the life of the current oxygen supply by almost two or three times, and which we hope will help towards coping with the ongoing crisis.
