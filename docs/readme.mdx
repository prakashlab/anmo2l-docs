# Pulse-Dose Oxygen Conservation System

With an extreme, critical shortage of oxygen in the ongoing second wave of COVID-19 in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, there is currently an urgent need for solutions to help conserve the already limited oxygen supply. **A device which conserves oxygen will extend the life of cylinders and will help in this climate of extreme shortages.**

In standard oxygen therapy, when a patient exhales the oxygen supply is wasted. This can waste up to approximately <sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> or more of oxygen in the tank, as inhalation only amounts to approximately <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> of the respiration cycle. A device which can detect patient inhalation and deliver oxygen during only the inspiratory phase can allow cylinders to last 2-3x longer.

We have built and characterized a functional prototype of such a device (Fig. 1) and are ready for validation testing, which will be carried out at UCSF and the VA Palo Alto Hospital at Stanford. Validation testing will involve simulation of diverse breathing patterns and lung conditions including COVID ARDS conditions, as well as testing with interfaces like simple face masks, and characterization of EtCO<sub>2</sub> to understand CO<sub>2</sub> washout issues.
