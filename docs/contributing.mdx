## Fund Scale-Up, Testing, and Deployment

Our team needs funds urgently to scale up testing and validation with multiple clinical partners including Stanford, UCSF, and several partners in India. We also need funds and support for Design for Manufacturing, large-scale procurement of parts supplies, and bringing on-board multiple manufacturers in India, Nepal, and Africa.

We are looking for:

1. financial support to scale this approach beyond a prototype to large scale production
2. electrical engineers with medical device background, specially power related issues and alarm systems for ventilation equipment
3. additional manufacturing partners - who are engaged in the oxygen supply value chain in India and have manufacturing capacity
4. folks with regulatory experience and clinical validation experience in India - to help our manufacturing partners to get this device through the regulatory process
5. feedback on our proposed design

If interested, please contact Deepak Krishnamurthy (deepak90@stanford.edu) and Manu Prakash (manup@stanford.edu).
