## Fund Scale-Up, Testing, and Deployment

Our team needs funds urgently to scale up testing and validation with multiple clinical partners including Stanford, UCSF, and several partners in India. We also need funds and support for Design for Manufacturing, large-scale procurement of parts supplies, and bringing on-board multiple manufacturers in India, Nepal, and Africa.
