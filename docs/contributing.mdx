We are looking for:

1. financial support to scale this approach beyond a prototype to large scale production
2. electrical engineers with medical device background, specially power related issues and alarm systems for ventilation equipment
3. additional manufacturing partners - who are engaged in the oxygen supply value chain in India and have manufacturing capacity
4. folks with regulatory experience and clinical validation experience in India - to help our manufacturing partners to get this device through the regulatory process
5. feedback on our proposed design

If interested, please contact Deepak Krishnamurthy (deepak90@stanford.edu).
